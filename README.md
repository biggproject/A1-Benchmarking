# A1 - Energy benchmarking of buildings

This is an example of a pipeline that uses [BIGG-Ontology](https://www.github.com/biggproject/Ontology) harmonised data as input to generate results for the energy benchmarking of buildings. This comparison is made in terms of energy use, cost, and emissions, and can be performed from the longitudinal point of view, when compare result of one building across its own timeline, and from a cross-sectional point of view, when compare results among similar buildings.

## Software requirements

This pipeline uses R and MLFlow to run. In addition several of the R code implemented extensively uses the R-packaged AI Toolbox [biggr](https://www.github.com/biggproject/biggr), developed during the BIGG project. 

## How to use?



### Install requirements



### Run the pipeline
